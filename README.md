# What is NikeDockClock?
Dock Clock designed for macOS, themed off of the Apple Watch Nike Face.
# Compatibility
This app is only compatible with macOS Catalina and later (10.15 - 11.0). Do not request for compatibility with Mojave and earlier as the app will not work properly and the code will never be properly compatible.

After moving the app, you can open the app and be greeted with a window of 24-hour time. You can close the window and the time will be ticking in the dock. The clock automatically changes.
